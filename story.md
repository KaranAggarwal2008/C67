Commit is adding the work to the HISTORY of the works you are doing. You can move back and forward in your commits.
git divides our work area into 3 stages: 1. Working directory: Where we are creating and making edits to our files. 2. Staging area: When the files are ready to be committed, we have to stage them first. 3. Local GIt Repository: After the files are committed, they become a part of commit hist
